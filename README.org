* usage 

The code needs an Input file describing the parameters to be fitted.
An example of such an input file is nonext_freeall.inp.

to execute (must be in the folder with the data):

python ../src/cont_fit_mcmc_abso.py nonext_freeall.inp outputname [options]

To get help on the options do:

python ../src/cont_fit_mcmc_abso.py -h

with the options you can control the fitting parameters, number of
MCMC steps, number of walkers etc.

In case of doubts let me know.
